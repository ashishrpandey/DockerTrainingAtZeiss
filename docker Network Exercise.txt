The output above also shows that the bridge network is scoped locally. This means that the network only exists on this Docker host. This is true of all networks using the bridge driver - the bridge driver provides single-host networking.

All networks created with the bridge driver are based on a Linux bridge (a.k.a. a virtual switch).
